<h1 align="center"> Factory + Dependency Injection</h1>

## Factory

Factory Method is a creative design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows
subclasses to change the type of objects that will be created

## Dependency Injection

Dependency Injection is a design pattern used to avoid the high level of code coupling within software. Systems with low
code coupling are better because they increase the ease of maintenance / implementation of new features and allow the
use of mocks to perform unit tests.

## Project

The project was made as a way to learn to write code to train Software Architecture, Automated Tests and Dependency
Injection. All the experience acquired in this project was due to the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyOJ2jjBtBs) by Filipe Deschamps that explains all the
details of the implementation.

## Technology

This project was developed with the following technologies:

- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
